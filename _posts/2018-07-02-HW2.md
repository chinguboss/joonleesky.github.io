## 1.  Write a short “interface review” for the picture organizing software based on principles, guidelines, and mental model.

 Among various photo organizing softwares, I decided to use **ACDSee 20** which was evaluated as the best photo organizing software in top ten reviews. ACDSee was the only software which rated 10/10 in organizing options including various organizing options provided. My short interface assessment is based on major principles, window desktop application guidelines and user’s mental model in terms of human computer interactions. 

### Principles

 First of all, I want to assess this application in terms of major principles. Principles are very important aspect in desining and implementing HCI since those are fundamental and widely applicable criteria. 

#### Managing Subtasks

Task management is very well implemented in this application, since each subtasks are straightforward and reasonably divided. Major options Manage, Photos, View, Develop, and Edit are well divided and pictograms are pretty clear. Reasonable division also helps me find functions very easily.<br><br>

#### Consistency

This application is also providing provides exceptional services in terms of consistency. Consistencies of GUI layout, fonts, and colours are very well preserved which is shown below.

<img src = "/assets/images/hci/hw2/2.png" width = "183" height = "400" style = "margin-right:20px">
<img src = "/assets/images/hci/hw2/3.png" width = "200" height = "500"><br><br>

#### Prevent errors

Since users frequently make errors, preventing error and providing closures are also very important aspect of the applications. Whenever I make inappropriate selections, error messages came out with specific, constructive guidelines.

<img src = "/assets/images/hci/hw2/5.png" width = "230" height = "120"><br><br>

#### Closures

Closures were appropriately provided after each task/subtask is over, where I can easily find out my progress. 

<img src = "/assets/images/hci/hw2/6.png" width = "150" height = "70"><br><br>

#### Natural and Intuitive

 Lots of pictograms are affordable and editing options are ergonomic. In terms of looking for the process of editing, RGB curve was very simple and straightforward way to show abstraction. Moreover, I can easily guess out their own functions by their designs and instructions.<br><br>

### Guidelines

However, since principles are quite high level of instructions to follow, it may not provide appropriate services in terms of various aspects. Therefore, I would like to assess this application more specifically by window desktop application guidelines in terms of accessibility and user interface design guidelines by Smith and Mosier since this application is picture related program. 

#### Accessibility

First criteria is accessibility guideline, for users who have disabilities and impairments. For cognitive guidelines, it recommends to use progressive disclosure to hide complexity and provide editable drop-down lists. As shown below, closure of the menus are well maintained and I could only see the specific lists when I put my mouse on.

<img src = "/assets/images/hci/hw2/8.png" width = "300" height = "200"><br><br>

There are also guidelines to provide equipment independent services in terms of equipment disabilities. I can say these guidelines are very well preserved, since there is speicific documents that describes managing application only with keyboard or mouse.

<img src = "/assets/images/hci/hw2/7.png" width = "700" height = "200"><br><br>

#### User Interface Design

##### Data Protection

Users usually attempt to ensure the security of the information the application holds. Therefore, in picture organizing software, backing up the data will be essential. However,**ACDSee** synchrnozies with online library only with flickr, SmugMug and Zenfolio. Since these are not widely used software, I can hardly give good points in data protection.

##### Response Time

Whenever I click the organizing button, it takes 3~4 seconds for pictures to be organized. However since there are no pop up messeages such as *waiting* or *progress bar*, it gave me a little bit of confusion on my progress.

### Congnitive Science and Human Factors

#### Short-term memory

 Last assessment was made in terms of cognitive science and human factors. Cognitive science provided the knowledge that human information processing is the interaction between long-term memory and short-term memory and our short-term memory is only capable of processing 5~9 chunks of information. I can confidently say that tasks were divided up to 5~9 chunks which exploits our short-term memory characteristics very well as shown below.

<img src = "/assets/images/hci/hw2/9.png" width = "350" height = "200"><br><br>

#### Norman's theory
 Norman’s theory about stages of action gave us the brief overlook into mental operations behind our actions. Norman’s main contribution was that we have to provide services which is close to our mental model. I can say this application is exploiting norman's theory very well since in picture rating system, there are various ways application supports to access which match my intentions.

## 2. Can the usage of the software (or equally the way one accomplishes the task of picture organizing) be modeled as a sequence of decisions?

Below is the designed model to represent the picture organizing as the sequence of decisions.

## 3. Apply the GOMS methodology for a typical task as to be achieved by the software you chose above.

 I would like to apply GOMS methodology to organize picture with date criteria. For this case, I assume user is going to satisfy for the organized outcome.
1. Point to ACDSee Photo Studio file icon P
2. Click mouse button BB
3. Wait for program Responses R1
4. Point to Organize button P
5. Click mouse button B
6. Point to Group icon P
7. Click mouse button B
8. Wait for program Responses R2
9. Point empty space in application display P
10. Press and hold right mouse button B
11. Point to New item P
12. Press and hold right mouse button B
13. Point to Folder menu P
14. Click mouse button B
15. Drag pictures to new File icon P
16. Release mouse button B
17. Point to original window P <br>

**Expected time**<br>
= 8*P + 8*B + W(t) <br>
= 1.1 * 8 + 0.1 * 8 + 11(R1) + 0.3(R2) <br>
= **20.9sec** <br><br>
**Actual time**<br>
= **25.3sec**

**Difference** <br>
= **4.4sec** <br>
 Even though result is quite similar, Difference up to 4.5sec is not a brilliant modeling outcomes of GOMS-KLM. The main overhead was the **program responses time** which I pointed out in response time guideline.

## 4.Draw the system architecture including the major hardware and software components to realize this external device. Explain the flow of how the pen input is processed

### System Architecture

### Communication Flow

The main distinguishable point of **Samsung Galaxy Note9 Pen** is that it supports bluetooth to communicate with the device without direct touch. Therefore, I would like to explain for the communication flow for pen device to flip slides for powerpoints.<br><br>

1. push flip button ex)left or right
2. pushing button changes to signal
3. signal gets through the bluetooth chipset
4. processed signal is delivered to android bluetooth driver
5. Driver communicates with bluetooth device interface
6. Powerpoint application gets the signal to flip slides
