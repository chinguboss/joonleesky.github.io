## 1.  Write a short “interface review” for the so called mobile and voice based intelligent assistants 

In 2016, Google's AI Alphago wins one of the top professional go player 'Lee sedol'. The news has brought tremendous interest in AI and the mechanism of this A.I is using. Deep Learning served as the key mechnism in this A.I and now conquering various fields of A.I. Among these various fields, Voice recognition and natural language processing are one of the top fields deep learning has proven the success. This success enables the industries to make various application including **A.I personal assitant systems** that understands natural language voice commands and completes tasks for the user. Samsung Bixby, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri are one of the most well known applications.

### Interface

As I started my research for these applications to make a *interface review*, I recognized that Google Assitant was installed in my phone even though I didn't realize for about an year. Since I first started to use this application from a week ago, I personally think this review will be quite an unbiased review with a novice intelligence application user.

When I first turned on Google Assitant, only one message came up *What can I help you?*. Since performance of voice recognition was not very good, I had hard time giving question to this assistant. I first didn’t know what to do. If i was IT unfreindly user, I might get quite frustrated even though *convert to typing* button was on the left bottom.

Right picture was the screen which I got after asking *What can you do google assistant?*. Based on replies, application was capable of assisting communcation services, daily planning, smart home control, asking google and smart home control. 

### Expectation and Outcomes

Above these options, Setting up alarms, sending text messages, calling someone on my address,etc ... was my minimum level of expectation since these instructions are just straight forward.<br>
My interesting expectation was searching. Some examples of trials for searching were *what is today's weather?*,*translate this word to french*. Google assistant was capable of these questions,  since it's system was linked with google's search engine.<br>
My next question was *is google assistant capable of providing answers without answer?*. In other words, recommendations. Recommendation for my question 'what can I eat for dinner?' was Omelet. Since I really don't like omelet, this was one of the horrible recommendation. If I asked either ask my freind or my family, they would give my much nicer recommendation based on my taste.

To sum up, my personal feeling for usability of this assistant application was moderate. Since I didn't expect much for recommendations, services was satisfing but voice recognition was keep failing. Typing takes almost the same time as directly using other applications.  

### Universal Usuability

However, I belive there are three reasons this AI assistant will substitue many parts of human assistant and provides universal usability.<br>
**First**, technology for voice recognition is rapidly growing. In just a few years, there would be just a little difficulty for using high accuracy recognition services regardless of the smart phone's hardware. <br>
**Second**, recommendation businness is now showing dramatic success using A.I including netflix and amazon. However, all of these services is possible only if sufficient data is provided. Therefore, if people keep using these services and social network services are connected, they would provide me satisfactory recommendation. Moreover, after various logs are cummulated by users such as 'how long does it take for user to push next button?', AI can specify the types of users and provide different interfaces.<br>
**Lastly**, AI is starting to substitute traditional human communcation areas like below videos.

## 2.  Write a short “comparative interface review” for the travel planning web sites 

While traditional online travel agencies reserved hotels and made various guiding services, there were some criticism by customers that these agencies abuse infomation inequality to get higher benefits. Moreover, traditional travel products have limit to cover diverse travel styles of customers. Therefore, meta-search engine for hotel sites is gaining huge popularity. **Metasearch engines** are a unique search engine that displays the current rates of many different hotels in a given destination. I would like to compare interfaces between two famous hotel meta search engine sites which is **Trivago** and **HotelsCom** since I had experience using them.

### Front page
Below pictures are front pages of *Trivago* and *HotelsCom*.
I can hardly say there is difference between the front pages interface. I can even say the only difference is the base colour and the picture. These interfaces seems to reflect *Short-term memory* and *consistency* scheme. For short-term memory, only 4~5 options are needed to be filled out for searching. In terms of consistency, all the other hotel comparision sites including *hotelsCombine*, *Expedia* has the same looking front page. It seems that these sites is trying to give consistent interface to ensure user to easily adapt to new sites.

#### Trivago

#### HotelsCom
<br>
<img src = "/assets/images/hotels1.png" width = "600" height = "400">
<br>

### Search page
<br>
On the search page, there exists different focusing points each site was making.
*Trivago* seems to be following design guidelines quite well while *HotelsCom* don't. For users trying to get hotel in a small amount of time, *Trivago*seems more reasonable in terms of user's memory load. Moreover, we can view ranking of hotels based on *user's ratings*. While *Trivago* offers *0.5* scale starting from the *7* ,*HotlesCom* offers *1* scale starting from the *0*. It seems *HotelsCom* is providing too much information since only just the few of hotel's ratings are less than *7*.

However, *HotelsCom* will be definitely great choice for user wishing to get delicate choices. Moreover, options like *disabled facilities* is essential for specific users.
