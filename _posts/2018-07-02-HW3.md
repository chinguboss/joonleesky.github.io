## 1.  Requirements

### Overall objectives

 My Photo organizing application is mainly targeting on z-generation female users, assisting to organize large number of photos in convenience. It helps users to divide photos into albums and albums into collections in an easy manner. Users can apply different tags and keywords into photos in order to organize photos manually. Photos can also be organized automatically by application which includes organizing with timelines, locations, colors, people, and many other criteria. Application supports users to search photos with tags, keywords, timelines and even by images. For additional supports, application is connected with various social network services and easily edit and upload the photos.

### Major functional requirements

1. Providing various sizes of thumbnails to make users easier and faster to look at large collections of photos. 
2. Organizing photos manually by users. This includes users to provide different tags and keywords to photos. Photos automatically divided into albums with given tags and keywords,
3. Automatic photo organizing. Application read data present in digital photos and utilize given information to divide into albums. Each photo contains information about the date, locations and colors. Built-in classifiers in the application also categorize images in terms of people, subjects, and textures and assist to divide into albums.
4. Searching photos by given tags, keywords, dates, â€¦ with many other designated categories. It also support users to find the similar photos which user provides. 

### Major UI requirements

#### Functional

1. If all of the tags and keywords appear (Non-functional requirements 2), screen would be distracting. Therefore, emerging tags and keywords should be restricted to 5 and automatically recommended based on user histories. 
2. When searching photos with certain category, auto completion should be provided.
3. Whenever user makes new album or collections, previous status of organization should be backed up automatically. 
4. Automatic organization might takes considerable times. Calculate and notify the expected remaining time to users.

#### Non-Functional

1. In order to attract targeted z-generation users, apply trendy colors to the background. However, choose two main contrary colors for simplicity and clarity. 
2. When user is viewing thumbnails of photos, some of the tags and keywords icons should be appear top left corner easy to drag-drop the photo.

### Other Considerations

#### Target user group

Generation-Z, people who born between 1996 and 2014 are getting great attention in the contents market due to their consuming power and distinct consuming style. Since they used to concentrate only 8seconds for one content, speed should be one of the main consideration for the application. They are highly adapted in accepting new technologies and used to communicate through photos and videos not texts. Therefore, searching by photos with cutting edge technologies will be great attraction point. Moreover since they communicate through photos, application should deal with organizing large amount of photos. Therefore, automatic organizing functions should be provided.


#### Devices and Platform

For users convenience, both mobile application and window application will be provided and connected with cloud services.

<br>

### User's major requirements

1. Include photo search function. Searching can be done with tags, keywords, or even by other similar images.ex) users want to search their own dog photo, however most of the application only aid searching all of the dogs, not the particular one. 
2. Want more sophisticated organizing function. ex) All food photos should not be organized in one food album. Different kinds of food should be divided in different albums with tree structure. This can be done manually by providing various tags function or automatically by application itself.
3. In terms of secrecy, user want some secret album which is locked with passwords. Photos in this album should be hided other than this album.
4. Photo editing function must be included in the application.

### User's cognitive/ergonomic requirements

1. In terms of usage contexts, some of the users use this application while riding public transportation. Therefore, mistakes in touch can easily occur and prevention should be prepared. Ex)Photos are temporary saved in trash can rather than deleted right away.
2. Prevent users from suffering screen brightness. Add auto brightness control in the application.
3. If user continuously organize photos manually user might get wrist pain. Therefore, one of the user requires to delete photo by drag and drop not by clicking.
